# Welcome to Urban Array!

## Getting Started

Please fork and clone this repository to your machine. 

Run `npm install` to add all of the dependencies.  It may be necessary to run `npm install jquery@1.9.1` and `npm install typescript@3.3.3333` to add peer dependencies if they are not added automatically. Use `yarn start` or `rpm run start` to start the development server.  The development server will run on [localhost port 3000.](http://localhost:3000) 

Make sure you add the UA-Frontend-2.0 repository as a remote: 

``` git remote add upstream git@github.com:urbanarray/UA-Frontend-2.0.git ```

Please do all of your work on your own branch, not on the **master** or **development** branches. 

The master branch holds all of our our build files and is used for deployment only. The most up-to-date version of our React app can be found on the development branch. 

**Make sure you always pull from the development branch when starting your work and again prior to submitting a pull request to avoid conflicts.**

## Submitting a Pull Request

ESLint will run automatically every time you make a commit, and will warn you of any errors in your code. Please fix these before making a pull request. 

When you are ready to make a pull request, please provide some detail about what you did and the number of the Jira task you were working on (if applicable). Once you're ready to submit, please assign Hannah (hanna2895) as a reviewer and send me a message in the UA Slack channel to let me know that your code is ready for review.

I will review your code within one week of submission (at most) and either merge your PR or provide additional feedback.
